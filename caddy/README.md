## TODO

- Let `package.json` specify a version range? It seems like a nice feature to have, but it means we’d have to introduce a dependency to resolve the ranges, and we’d have to implement some form of locking logic. It doesn’t seem to be worth it.

# Radically Straightforward · Caddy

**☁️ Install [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as an npm package**

## Installation

```console
$ npm install @radically-straightforward/caddy
```

> **Note:** For quick-and-easy testing you may run Caddy from the command line with `npx` instead of installing it explicitly:
>
> ```console
> $ npx @radically-straightforward/caddy
> ```

> **Note:** By default the latest version of Caddy is installed. You may specify a version in `package.json` with a `caddy` property, for example:
>
> `package.json`
>
> ```json
> {
>   "caddy": "2.7.5"
> }
> ```

> **Note:** The Caddy binary is installed under `node_modules/.bin/`, along with other binaries for npm packages.

## Usage

```console
$ npx caddy
```

> **Note:** If the command above doesn’t work, which may happen in particular on Windows, use the path to the binary instead of `npx`:
>
> ```console
> > .\node_modules\.bin\caddy
> ```

Besides the Caddy binary, `@radically-straightforward/caddy` also comes with helpers to define a [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/caddyfile).

```typescript
import caddyfile from "@radically-straightforward/caddy";
import * as caddy from "@radically-straightforward/caddy";
```

<!-- DOCUMENTATION START: ./source/index.mts -->

### `Caddyfile`

```typescript
export type Caddyfile = string;
```

A type alias to make your type annotations more specific.

### `caddyfile()`

```typescript
export default function caddyfile(
  templateStrings: TemplateStringsArray,
  ...substitutions: Caddyfile[]
): Caddyfile;
```

A [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) for [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/caddyfile).

### `application()`

```typescript
export function application({
  hostname = "localhost",
  staticFilesPaths = ["static/"],
  userGeneratedFilesPaths = ["data/"],
  reverseProxyPorts = ["8000"],
  email = undefined,
  hstsPreload = false,
}: {
  hostname?: string;
  staticFilesPaths?: string[];
  userGeneratedFilesPaths?: string[];
  reverseProxyPorts?: string[];
  email?: string;
  hstsPreload?: boolean;
} = {}): Caddyfile;
```

A Caddyfile template for an application.

**[Global Options](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options)**

- Turn off administrative interface.

- Set an `email` to the system administrator, which is used for contacting about certificates. If an `email` isn’t provided, then the server is run in development mode with local self-signed certificates.

**`(common)` [snippet](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#snippets)**

Enables compression for better performance and sets the following headers:

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Tells the browser that moving forward it should only attempt to load this origin with HTTPS (not HTTP). The `hstsPreload` parameter controls whether to set the [`preload` directive](https://hstspreload.org/)—by default it’s `false`, but it’s recommended that you opt into preloading by setting `hstsPreload: true`.

- `Cache-Control`: Turns off HTTP caching. This is the best setting for the dynamic parts of the application: in the best case the cache may be stale, and in the worst case the cache may include private information that could leak even after signing out. For static files, we recommend that you overwrite this header to enable caching, for example, `header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"`.

- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Turns off `Content-Type` sniffing, because: 1. The application may break if content sniffing goes wrong; and 2. Content sniffing needs access to the response body but the response body may take long to arrive in streaming responses. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` header appropriately.

- `X-XSS-Protection`: Disables XSS filtering because, ironically, [XSS filtering may make the application vulnerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection#vulnerabilities_caused_by_xss_filtering).

- `Permissions-Policy`: Opts out of [FLoC](https://web.dev/articles/floc).

- `Origin-Agent-Cluster`: Tells the browser to try and isolate the process running the application.

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Allows the application to retrieve content only from the same origin. Inline styles are allowed. Frames and objects are disabled. Forms may only be submitted to the same origin. If you need to serve images from third-party websites (for example, as part of content generated by users), setup a content proxy (it also solves the potential issue of [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content)).

- `Cross-Origin-*-Policy`: Allow only the same origin to load content from the application. This is the converse of the `Content-Security-Policy` header. For files that you wish to allow embedding in other origins, set `header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy cross-origin`.

- `X-Frame-Options`: Disallows the application from being embedded in a frame.

- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`: Disallows the application from being embedded in a PDF, a Flash document, and so forth.

- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`: Disables DNS prefetching, because DNS prefetching could leak information about the application to potentially untrusted DNS servers.

- `Referrer-Policy`: Tells the browser to not send the `Referer` request header. This makes the application more secure because external links don’t leak information about the URL that the user was on.

### [`caddy-npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caddy-npm)

Only supports specific versions of Caddy and requires an update to the package itself when a new version of Caddy is released. At the time of this writing (2023-11-14) the latest supported version is Caddy 2.1.1 from 2020-06-20 (more than three years old).

`@radically-straightforward/caddy`, on the other hand, supports new versions of Caddy as soon as they’re released.
