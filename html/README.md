# Radically Straightforward ¬∑ HTML

**üìÑ HTML with Tagged Templates**

## Installation

```console
$ npm install @radically-straightforward/html
```

## Usage

```typescript
import html, { HTML } from "@radically-straightforward/html";
import * as htmlHelpers from "@radically-straightforward/html";
```

<!-- DOCUMENTATION START: ./source/index.mts -->

### `HTML`

```typescript
export type HTML = string;
```

A type alias to make your type annotations more specific.

### `html()`

```typescript
export default function html(
  templateStrings: TemplateStringsArray,
  ...substitutions: (string | string[])[]
): HTML;
```

**TODO:** Review, test, and document.

### `sanitize()`

```typescript
export function sanitize(
  text: string,
  replacement: string = sanitize.replacement,
): string;
```

Sanitize text for safe insertion in HTML.

`sanitize()` escapes characters that are meaningful in HTML syntax and replaces invalid XML characters with a string of your choosing‚Äîby default, an empty string (`""`). You may provide the `replacement` as a parameter or set a new default by overwriting `sanitize.replacement`. For example, to use the Unicode replacement character:

```typescript
sanitize.replacement = "ÔøΩ";
```

> **Note:** The `` html`___` `` tagged template already calls `sanitize()`, so you must **not** call `sanitize()` yourself or the sanitization would happen twice.

> **Note:** The sanitization that we refer to here is at the character level, not cleaning up certain tags while preserving others. For that, we recommend [`rehype-sanitize`](https://npm.im/rehype-sanitize).

> **Note:** Even this sanitization isn‚Äôt enough in certain contexts, for example, HTML attributes without quotes: `<a href=${sanitize(___)}>`.

### `escape()`

```typescript
export function escape(text: string): string;
```

Escape characters that are HTML syntax and make `text` safe to interpolate in HTML.

What sets this implementation apart from existing ones are the following:

- **Performance.**

  The performance of the `escape()` function matters because it‚Äôs used a lot to escape user input when rendering HTML with the `` html`___` `` tagged template.

  The following are some details on how this implementation is made faster:

  - The relatively new string function `.replaceAll()` when used with a string parameter is faster than `.replace()` with a global regular expression.

  - Perhaps surprisingly, calling `.replaceAll()` multiple times is faster than using a single regular expression of the kind `/[&<>"']/g`.

  - And even if we were to use a single regular expression, using `switch/case` would have been faster than the lookup tables that most other implementations use.

  - And also if we were to use regular expressions, using the flag `v` incurs on a very small but consistent performance penalty.

  - And also if we were to use regular expressions, `.replace()` is marginally but consistently faster than `.replaceAll()`.

  - Measurements performed in Node.js 21.2.0.

- **Supports modern browsers only.**

  Most other implementations treat characters such as `` ` ``, which could cause problems in Internet Explorer 8 and older.

  Some other implementations avoid transforming `'` into the entity `&apos;`, because that entity isn‚Äôt understood by some versions of Internet Explorer.

### `invalidXMLCharacters`

```typescript
export const invalidXMLCharacters;
```

A regular expression that matches invalid XML characters.

Use this to remove or replace invalid XML characters, or simply to detect that a string doesn‚Äôt contain them. This is particularly useful when generating XML based on user input.

This list is based on **Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition), ¬ß¬†2.2 Characters**¬†(https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#charsets). In particular, it includes:

1. `\u{0}`, which is always invalid in XML.
2. The gaps between the allowed ranges in the production rule for `[2] Char` from the ‚ÄúCharacter Range‚Äù grammar.
3. The discouraged characters from the **Note** in that section of the document.

Notably, it does **not** include the ‚Äú"compatibility characters", as defined in Unicode‚Äù mentioned in that section of the document, because that list was difficult to find and doesn‚Äôt seem to be very important.

**Example**

```javascript
someUserInput.replace(invalidXMLCharacters, ""); // Remove invalid XML characters.
someUserInput.replace(invalidXMLCharacters, "ÔøΩ"); // Replace invalid XML characters with the Unicode replacement character.
someUserInput.match(invalidXMLCharacters); // Detect whether there are invalid XML characters.
```

  1. We export the regular expression, instead of encapsulating it in auxiliary functions, which arguably makes it more useful.
  2. We are more strict on what we consider to be valid characters (see description above).
  3. We use the regular expression flag `v` instead of `u` (see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicodeSets>).
