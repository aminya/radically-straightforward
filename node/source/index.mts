/**
 * Graceful termination. `await` for this function between the code that starts the application and the code that gracefully terminates it. If the code that gracefully terminates the application takes longer than `timeout` to complete, then the application terminates forcefully.
 *
 * > **Note:** This function must be called at most once in your application.
 *
 * > **Note:** What determines that the application should terminate are the `signals`, which by default include operating system signals, for example, `SIGINT` sent by `⌃C`, `SIGTERM` sent by `kill`, `SIGUSR2` sent by [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), `exit` send by Node.js in the case of an uncaught exception, and so forth.
 *
 * > **Note:** Some signals, for example, `SIGKILL` sent by `kill -9`, cannot be handled and cause the process to terminate immediately without the opportunity to run any more code.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import express from "express";
 * import * as utilities from "@radically-straightforward/utilities";
 * import * as node from "@radically-straightforward/node";
 *
 * const application = express();
 * application.get("/", (request, response) => {
 *   response.send("Hello world");
 * });
 * const server = application.listen(3000);
 * const backgroundJob = utilities.backgroundJob(
 *   { interval: 3 * 1000 },
 *   async () => {
 *     console.log("Background job.");
 *   },
 * );
 * console.log("shouldTerminate(): Press ⌃C to gracefully terminate...");
 * await node.shouldTerminate();
 * console.log("shouldTerminate(): Starting graceful termination...");
 * // If you comment one of the lines below the application remains running for 10 seconds, when ‘shouldTerminate()’ terminates it forcefully.
 * server.close();
 * backgroundJob.stop();
 * ```
